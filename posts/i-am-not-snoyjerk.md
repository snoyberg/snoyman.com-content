There's a user on Reddit with the handle snoyjerk. Since there has
been some confusion recently, I'd like to set the record straight:

* I am not snoyjerk
* I don't know who snoyjerk is
* I have never used "sock puppet" accounts to discuss Haskell or other
  programming topics.

    * I have in the past used alternative accounts to discuss other
      interests, like weight lifting, but have since stopped to avoid
      any possible confusion.

* Unless I'm overlooking something, all of my social media accounts
  are under the name snoyberg.

    * I obviously can't guarantee that every snoyberg out there is me,
      there are simply too many social media sites.
    * I also have access to some other social media accounts. For
      example, I'm pretty sure I have the credentials for FP
      Complete's Twitter account. But I'd imagine that's pretty
      obviously not intended to obfuscate my identity.

In the past, I've jokingly/sarcastically had some banter with
snoyjerk, which unfortunately gave the impression&mdash;or even
stated&mdash; that it was, in fact, my account. I can't blame anyone
but myself for that. I apologize for the confusion, and hope this sets
the record straight.

Thanks to simonmic, duplode, and and gelisam for helping clarify this
in yesterday's Reddit thread.
